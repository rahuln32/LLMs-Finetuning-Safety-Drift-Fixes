# LLMs-Finetuning-Safety (Llama2)

This directory contains necessary code to fine-tune Llama2 models and evaluate their safety alignment, built upon the official Llama2 fine-tuning guidance ([llama-recipe](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes)).

# Quick Start

Follow the notebooks provided:
- [Safety-drift-plus-fixes.ipynb](Safety-drift-plus-fixes.ipynb) -- fine-tuning with benign datasets: Alpaca and fixes. Contains different kinds of finetuning and fixes, compared across safety and utility.
